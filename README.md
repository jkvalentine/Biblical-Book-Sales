<p>One of my favorite podcasts, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, examines each chapter of Harry Potter through a different thematic lens relating to one or several sacred texts. With the Harry Potter as the most popular book series of all time and The Bible as the best selling book of all time, I wanted to explore the topical overlap of this best selling series and, by extension, other best selling texts, to determine whether topical similarity to The Bible is a good predictor of sales.</p>
